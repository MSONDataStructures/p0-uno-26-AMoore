# The Plan

## Goal
* win
## How?
* pure skill and logic


## What is needed for logic
### keep track of others
#### make a class for all of them
   * their danger
    * thier  points (if high then target)
   * their hands
    * how many
    * most likely color
    * amount of specials left

### know cards I have
   * sort by allowed
#### value them all
   * number cards are similar to thier value
   * special cards much more
    * maybe literally how the cards are valued
   * also need to make sure color is included
    * also amount of cards in each color
    * get rid of cards with high amounts or low amounts of type color?

### know strategy
#### Know other players
   * rank based on amount of points to target
#### Know deck
   * count cards... how? ... good question, ill get back to you when i figure it out
